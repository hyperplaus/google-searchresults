Hello world!
This is the second project from HTML/CSS chapter with one slight difference from the last one (google_homepage), this is the difficult version.
At the end of the project, I should have a page that closely resembles the Google search results page. Hopefully, it will take me no more than 5 days.
With that being said, let's start!

26.02.2019 - Create a repo, start the project.
28.02.2019 - Apply styles, work on header.
02.03.2019 - Style body and footer; finish header.
